## Project Overview

The TF9 website is built using modern, efficient web technologies to ensure a seamless user experience. The stack includes:

- **Zola**: A fast, static site generator designed for simplicity and performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **JavaScript**: Enhancing interactivity and functionality on the website.
- **Markdown**: Used for writing content in a simple and readable format, which Zola converts into HTML.
- **HTML**: The backbone of the web pages, structuring the content and defining the layout of the website.

## Installation

To get started with the development environment, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Zola**: [Installation Guide](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
2. **Tailwind CSS**: [Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
3. **Node.js & npm**: Required for managing JavaScript dependencies.


## Getting Started

Once these dependencies are installed, you can clone this repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://git.ourworld.tf/tfcoop/www_tf9_new
cd www_tf9_new

```

### Reviewing New Website Changes Locally

#### Access the Terminal
Within your code editor, open the terminal or command line interface. Make sure you are in the root directory of your website project in the terminal.

1. Create an Issue
Feel free to [create a new issue](https://git.ourworld.tf/tfgrid/circle_web_presence/issues) to report an error on the website, or if you have any suggestions on website improvements. 


#### Run the Build Script: 
Type **./build.sh** in the terminal and press Enter. This script is responsible for building or compiling your website code and assets.

#### Run the Start Script: 
After the build process is complete, type **./start.sh** in the terminal and press Enter. This script typically starts a local development server.

Wait for the Localhost URL: The start script will initiate a local development server, and it will display a localhost URL, such as **http://localhost:xxxx**, where xxxx is a port number. Wait for this URL to be generated.

### Open the URL in Your Browser
Once the localhost URL is generated, open your web browser and enter the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:xxxx). This will display your website locally, allowing you to review the changes you made.
