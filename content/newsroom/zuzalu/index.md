Some of the team has arrived to Zuzalu in Montenegro for this weekend's New Cities & Network States event. Kristof will be speaking on Sunday and we'll also be hosting several side events including a hackathon around the Web3 Gateway.

<br/>

Other speakers include Vitalik Buterin (founder of Ethereum), Balaji Srinivasan (author of The Network State), and Mark Lutter (founder & chairman of the Charter Cities Institute).

<br/>

Looking forward to a productive event with a like-minded community of people and sharing how ThreeFold provides the ideal underlying infrastructure for new cities and network states!
