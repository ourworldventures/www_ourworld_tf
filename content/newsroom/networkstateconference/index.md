Florian represented ThreeFold and OurWorld on stage at the Network State Conference in Singapore last week, to share a powerful solution for any network state.

<br>

“We are building the infrastructure layer for Network State as a Service by combining a decentralized cloud running on bare metal with a digital free zone from where we can all exist freely.”

<br>

Florian explained that if we want to create “cloud-first’ network states, “we definitely don’t want to run them on Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. Because privacy is power – and we need to own our digital life, and we need to own our data.”

<br>

“We built a network layer and platform where any community can deploy directly its own sovereign cloud.”
