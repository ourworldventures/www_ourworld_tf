I am a true professional Swiss army knife, versatile and always ready to take on new challenges. Having started in retail, I developed skills in management, business development and customer relations. Looking for adventure, I turned to hospitality, then spent six exciting years as a professional skipper and yacht captain, mastering leadership at sea. Returning to land, I embarked on wealth management, applying my expertise in a new field.

<br>

Today, at 40, my passion for discovery remains strong. My mission (in addition to private wealth management), at OurWorld is to help to develop its ecosystem, by selecting investors and companies aligned with the “planet first / people first” principle.

<br>

Whether on land or at sea, I am ready to take on any challenge with determination and enthusiasm.
